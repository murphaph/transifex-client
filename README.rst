 Custom Server Project Transifex Command-Line Tool
=============================

The Custom Transifex Command-line Client is a command line tool that enables
you to easily manage your translations within a project without the need
of an elaborate UI system.

You can use the command line client to easily create new resources, map
locale files to translations and synchronize your Transifex project with
your local repository and vice verca. Translators and localization
managers can also use it to handle large volumes of translation files
easily and without much hassle.

responsibility.
